VivahSphere wasn't born in a boardroom or during a hackathon. It was born in the back of a car travelling through Tier-2 towns in Tamil Nadu, and later, at a dining table covered in receipts, trying to make sense of a chaos every Indian family knows too well.

## 🚗 The "Break" That Became a Mission

In August 2025, I quit my role as a Cloud Engineer. The plan was simple: take a two-month career break before my sister-in-law's wedding in November.

My father-in-law had passed away, and she was the last of three daughters to get married. In our tradition, that responsibility falls on the entire family. As sons-in-law, we stepped up to support the household.

By September, "helping out" had turned into a full-time logistical operation. We spent weeks travelling to towns across Tamil Nadu, personally inviting relatives. It was exhausting, beautiful, and chaotic. But the real challenge wasn't the travel—it was the data.

## ⚔️ The "Diary vs. Spreadsheet" Battle

The wedding was a grand affair, with expenses shared between the bride’s and groom’s families. On our side, spending was decentralized and frantic:
* 📓 My mother-in-law was paying for traditional items, noting them in a **handwritten diary**.
* 🚛 My co-brother was handling logistics.
* 🛍️ My elder sister-in-law was managing purchases.
* 📊 I was trying to track everything in a **Google Sheet**.

When the celebrations ended and the guests left, we sat down to tally the accounts. It was a nightmare.

We had diary scribbles that didn't match bank statements. We had "pending payments" no one remembered. We had to reconcile shared costs with the groom's side, which had its own separate tracking system.

I sat there looking at my complex spreadsheet and my mother-in-law’s simple diary, and I realized: **Neither of these tools actually works for an Indian wedding.**

Spreadsheets are too rigid for parents. Diaries don't calculate totals or split costs. And neither of them can tell you if you've forgotten to pay the caterer.

## 🌱 From Frustration to Code

That frustration was the seed for **VivahSphere**.

I realized we weren't unique. Every single family goes through this. We juggle Excel sheets, WhatsApp groups, and notebooks, trying to manage an event that has the budget of a small business and the complexity of a film production.

I decided to build the tool I wished I had in November.

## 🔨 What I'm Building

VivahSphere is an all-in-one "Wedding Operating System." I'm building it using **React, Vite, and Supabase** to solve three specific friction points I faced personally:

1.  **💰 The "Shared Expense" Chaos:** A Collaborative Dashboard where multiple family members (even non-tech-savvy in-laws) can track expenses in one place. No more merging spreadsheets.
2.  **🕵️‍♂️ The "Who Paid What?" Confusion:** Smart Expense Tracking that links payments directly to specific vendors and events.
3.  **🚚 The Logistics:** Handling the multi-day, multi-city reality of Indian weddings, not just a single-day reception.

## 🚀 The Feature Set (MVP)

* 🤖 **AI Wedding Planner**: A smart assistant to manage tasks and budget.
* 💌 **Invitation Builder**: Generating digital invitations with AI-generated hero images.
* 📈 **Reports & Analytics**: Scheduled email reports to keep the family updated on budget burn rates and RSVP status.
* 🤝 **Vendor Manager**: Centralized booking and payment tracking.

This is the first product coming out of my new Product Studio. I'll be documenting the technical challenges and the "build in public" journey right here.

*Stay tuned.*
