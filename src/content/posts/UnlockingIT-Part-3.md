In [Part 2](https://gokg4.in/unlocking-it-the-no-code-low-code-journey-part-2), I left off at the start of 2020. My agency was growing, and I was comfortable in the niche I had carved out. Then, everything changed.

## 🦠 The Pandemic Impact
When COVID-19 hit, the impact on my client base—mostly MSMEs—was immediate. Projects were cancelled, budgets evaporated, and payment timelines stretched indefinitely.

The financial instability, combined with new personal responsibilities after getting married, forced a hard reality check. The freelance roller coaster was no longer sustainable. I needed stability.

## 🔒 Closing Shop
I made the tough decision to wind down my agency and enter the job market. It wasn't easy letting go of the business I built, but it was necessary. I updated my resume and started looking for roles that matched my unique blend of design and dev skills.

## 🌉 The Bridge Opportunity
In October 2020, I got a break. A company reached out with a freelance project: **Emergency Migration.**

They had suffered a security breach on their WordPress site and wanted out. They needed to move to a static architecture while keeping their design and SEO rankings intact. It was the perfect use case for my stack.

I rebuilt their site in **Webflow**, mirroring the original structure pixel-for-pixel, and deployed it on **Netlify**. The security issues vanished, performance skyrocketed, and the client was thrilled.

## 🤝 Building Trust
That success led to a second project: building a website from scratch for their sister company, a Cloud Service Provider. Working closely with their content team, we shipped a fast, modern site.

Then came a more complex challenge: building an online ordering system for a popular South Indian restaurant. The requirement? Deep integration with their **Clover POS**.

I fell back on my research. I knew **Ecwid** was one of the few platforms with native Clover integration. I implemented it, ensuring orders flowed seamlessly from the web directly to the kitchen printer.

## 💼 From Freelancer to Senior Dev
The relationship with the Cloud Service Provider was strong. I realized our goals aligned, so I pitched them a proposal: hire me full-time.

They agreed. I joined as a **Senior Web Developer**. After the uncertainty of the lockdowns, the stability of a full-time paycheck was a massive relief. But more importantly, I was now inside a tech company.

## ☁️ The Cloud Era: Azure & Logic Apps
Working at a Cloud Provider exposed me to enterprise-grade tools. I started working with **Azure Logic Apps**, using it to build complex integration workflows and custom ordering solutions for restaurants. It was "Low Code" on steroids—connecting disparate systems without reinventing the wheel.

I didn't stop there. Over the next 18 months, I aggressively upskilled:
* 💻 **Languages:** Dabbled in Dart and Crystal.
* ☁️ **Cloud:** Earned my **Azure Fundamentals** certification.
* 🏗️ **AWS:** Enrolled in a comprehensive AWS course.

## 🚀 The Big Leap
My focus on cloud technologies paid off. I earned my **AWS Certified Developer Associate** badge, proving I could do more than just build websites—I could engineer cloud-native solutions.

Today, I work at one of India's top IT services companies. I’ve gone from editing HTML in Notepad to architecting solutions for enterprise clients.

## 🔮 What's Next?
The journey doesn't stop here. I am currently targeting the **AWS Solution Architect Associate** and **Azure Solutions Architect Expert** certifications.

Looking back, the path wasn't a straight line. It went from NGO volunteer -> Freelancer -> Agency Owner -> Cloud Engineer. But every step, every broken layout, and every server migration taught me something valuable.

*Thank you for following my journey.*
