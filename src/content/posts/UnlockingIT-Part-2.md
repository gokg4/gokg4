In [Part 1](https://gokg4.in/unlocking-it-the-no-code-low-code-journey-part-1), I shared how I went from editing text files in Notepad to building responsive layouts. With the fundamentals of HTML and CSS under my belt, I was ready to scale. The next phase wasn't just about code; it was about tooling, workflow, and eventually, business.

## 🎨 The Webflow Pivot
As I looked for ways to speed up development, I tested the usual suspects: [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Wix](https://www.wix.com/). They were fine, but they felt restrictive. Then I found [Webflow](https://webflow.com/).

Webflow was different. It offered a visual interface that mapped directly to CSS properties (Flexbox, Grid, etc.), but its killer feature was **Code Export**. It gave me the speed of a site builder without locking me into a walled garden. I could design visually, export the clean HTML/CSS, and host it wherever I wanted. It became the bridge between design and development I had been looking for.

## 🚀 Launching the Agency
Armed with a pro-level workflow, I took the plunge and started my own web design and development agency.

### 🛠️ The Stack
To deliver professional work, I needed a professional pipeline. My toolkit evolved into a modern "Jamstack-lite" setup:

* 🎨 **Design/Build:** Webflow (for visual development)
* 📝 **Editor:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for fine-tuning exported code)
* 📨 **Forms:** [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) (handling backend form submissions on static sites)
* 🐙 **Version Control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### ⚡ The Netlify Shift
Initially, I used SiteGround, but around 2018, I discovered [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It was a game-changer. The seamless Git integration, free SSL, and global CDN made traditional hosting feel archaic. I migrated my workflow entirely to Netlify, ensuring my client sites were fast, secure, and easy to update.

## 💼 The Client Roster
My first client was an Engineering & Construction company specializing in pre-engineered buildings—a serious project that tested my new stack. It was a success.

Referrals started trickling in. I landed a Fly Ash distributor, followed by a diverse mix of clients: two NGOs, a real estate firm, a manufacturer, travel agencies, and even an astrologer and a temple. The portfolio was growing, and so was the complexity of the requests.

## 🛒 Entering E-commerce
Soon, clients started asking for "Buy Now" buttons. I needed to move from static brochures to dynamic e-commerce, but I didn't want to abandon my static site workflow.

I evaluated [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [CS-Cart](https://www.cs-cart.com/), and [SnipCart](https://snipcart.com/), but landed on [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com/). It allowed me to inject a full-featured shopping cart into my existing static sites via a simple script. Crucially, it had excellent support for Indian payment gateways and logistics, which was non-negotiable for my local clients.

## 🤖 Automation & Integration
As the businesses I supported grew, they needed their websites to *do* more. I started connecting their sites to other SaaS tools using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/) (now Make).

This allowed me to build automated workflows—like sending a lead from a contact form directly to a CRM or triggering a Slack alert when a purchase was made. I wasn't just building websites anymore; I was building business systems.

## 🛑 The Halt
From 2016 to 2020, the agency was on a steady upward trajectory. I was learning new tech, shipping code, and getting paid to do it.

Then came early 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic hit, and the world shut down. Projects were paused, budgets froze, and the uncertainty was palpable. The momentum I had built over four years came to a sudden, grinding halt.

*In Part 3, I’ll cover how I navigated the lockdown, adapted my strategy, and what came next.*
